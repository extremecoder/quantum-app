# Quantum App Template

## 🌟 Overview

This repository serves as a template structure for building quantum applications. It provides a standardized layout and integrated CI/CD pipeline to streamline the quantum development workflow. Created by the `quantum-cli-sdk init` command, this template enables developers to focus on writing quantum code while automating the testing, optimization, and deployment phases.

## 🚀 Development Workflow

This template implements an end-to-end quantum application development workflow:

1. **Source Development**: Write quantum code in your preferred framework (Qiskit/Cirq/Braket) within the `quantum_source/` directory
2. **Automatic IR Generation**: Source code is automatically converted to OpenQASM/IR format
3. **Validation & Security**: Code is validated and checked for potential security issues
4. **Optimization**: Circuits are optimized for depth and gate count
5. **Testing**: Automated tests are generated and executed
6. **Analysis**: Resources are estimated and performance is benchmarked
7. **Deployment**: Microservice wrappers are generated for API access
8. **Packaging**: Application is packaged for distribution
9. **Publishing**: Package is published to Quantum Hub (optional)

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

The included GitHub Actions workflow automates the quantum development process:

- Triggered on pushes to main branch or pull requests
- Executes all steps of the quantum development workflow
- Uses `quantum-cli-sdk` commands to perform each step
- Generates artifacts and reports for each stage
- Optional deployment to Quantum Hub

## 🧩 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Qiskit, Cirq, or Braket (depending on your preferred framework)
- quantum-cli-sdk (`pip install quantum-cli-sdk`)

### Development Steps

1. **Initialize your own project** based on this template:
   ```bash
   quantum-cli-sdk init my-quantum-project
   ```

2. **Write your quantum code** in the `quantum_source/` directory:
   ```python
   # Example: quantum_source/my_algorithm.py
   from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
   
   # Create your quantum circuits here
   qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
   qc.h(0)
   qc.cx(0, 1)
   qc.measure_all()
   ```

3. **Manually run steps** of the development workflow (optional):
   ```bash
   # Convert to OpenQASM
   quantum-cli-sdk generate-ir quantum_source/my_algorithm.py
   
   # Run validation
   quantum-cli-sdk validate openqasm/my_algorithm.qasm
   
   # Generate tests
   quantum-cli-sdk generate-tests openqasm/my_algorithm.qasm
   ```

4. **Push your changes** to trigger the CI/CD pipeline

## 📋 Customization

- Modify `.github/workflows/e2e-pipeline.yml` to customize the CI/CD pipeline
- Adjust `requirements.txt` to add dependencies specific to your project
- Create custom test cases in the `tests/` directory to supplement generated tests

## 🌐 Publishing to Quantum Hub

The CI/CD pipeline can automatically publish your quantum application to Quantum Hub:

1. Configure Quantum Hub credentials as GitHub Secrets:
   - `QUANTUM_HUB_USERNAME`
   - `QUANTUM_HUB_TOKEN`

2. Enable the publishing step in your workflow

3. Once published, your application will be available to users through the Quantum Hub marketplace
